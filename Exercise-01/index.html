        <ul>

          <li>
              Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and the salt in a medium bowl.
          </li>

          <li>
              Whisk milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until combined.
          </li>

          <li>
              By warming the milk slightly, the melted butter mixes into the milk instead of turning into small lumps.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="cook-list">Cook Pancakes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Heat a large skillet (or use griddle) over medium heat. The pan is ready if when you splatter a little water onto the pan surface, the water dances around the pan and eventually evaporates.</li>
                        
            <li> Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, pour milk mixture into the well and use a fork to stir until you no longer see clumps of flour. It is okay if the batter has small lumps â€“ it is important not to over-mix the batter.</li>
             

            <li> Lightly brush skillet with melted butter (this is optional if you have a high-quality non-stick pan).Use a 1/4-cup measuring cup to spoon batter onto the skillet. Gently spread the batter into a 4-inch circle.</li>
           
            <li> When edges look dry, and bubbles start to appear and pop on the top surfaces of the pancake,turn over This takes about 2 minutes. Once flipped, cook another 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked in the middle. Serve immediately with warm syrup, butter, and berries.</li>
